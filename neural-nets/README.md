## Exercises

### tensors.kojo
For `x = 15`, find the value of `y` and `dy/dx` for the following expressions -- by making appropriate changes to the code and then running it:
1. `y = 2x^2 + 3x + 7`
2. `y = 5x^3 + 6x`

### linear-regression.kojo
1. Change the values of `m` and `c` and then see how the neural net behaves (when you train it and then try to predict `y` for given `x`s)
2. Change the number of epochs of training and see how that impacts results

### nonlinear-regression.kojo
1. Change the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and then see how the neural net behaves
2. Change the number of epochs of training and see how that impacts results
3. Change the number of hidden units and see how that impacts results
